Moraveil: Cryptic Quest is a Celtic-inspired stealth game, focusing on memory. The player controls Riley Power, an African-Irish archeology professor searching for the fountain of youth, in order to cure his family’s hereditary disease, the proverbial “Celtic Curse.” Riley must explore the watery caves of the Isle of Skye, find the Tomb of Cu Chullain, and escape, all while being hunted by the Fae guardians of the map to Moraveil. If he has any hope of curing the disease that haunts his family, he must brave the tomb, and find his way to Moraveil’s fountain of youth.
